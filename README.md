首先，你需要在本地部署Android Debug Bridge (adb)环境，并将其添加到环境变量，使其可以在命令提示符中直接通过"adb"命令调用，而无需填写其他路径 \n
First, you need to deploy the Android Debug Bridge (adb) environment locally and add it to the environment variable so that it can be called directly from the Command Prompt through the "adb" command without filling in other paths

# If you just want to experience it, you can simply drag and drop the. apk file to fastinstall.bat (open the apk file through fastinstall.bat) without setting the default opening method, and then install the application through fastinstall.bat
